### Customization

Here is the layer:

- the entry point: `index.tsx` in `src/pages`
- the `Base` template: `Base.tsx` in `src/templates`
- use component blocks from `src/templates/*`
- use atomic components from `src/*`

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

You can create an optimized production build with:

```
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.
